# To manage the user access to all modules

  include CanCan::Ability

  def initialize(user)
    # Define abilities for the passed in user here. For example:
    #
    #   user ||= User.new # guest user (not logged in)
    #   if user.admin?
    #     can :manage, :all
    #   else
    #     can :read, :all
    #   end
    #
    # The first argument to `can` is the action you are giving the user
    # permission to do.
    # If you pass :manage it will apply to every action. Other common actions
    # here are :read, :create, :update and :destroy.
    #
    # The second argument is the resource the user can perform the action on.
    # If you pass :all it will apply to every resource. Otherwise pass a Ruby
    # class of the resource.
    #
    # The third argument is an optional hash of conditions to further filter the
    # objects.
    # For example, here the user can only update published articles.
    #
    #   can :update, Article, :published => true

    user ||= User.new # guest user (not logged in)

    # If you want only CRUD actions on object, you should create custom action that called :crud
    # for example, and use it instead of :manage:
    alias_action :create, :read, :update, :destroy, to: :crud

    can :crud, Book if user.role? :admin

    can :crud, UserBook if user.role? :user

    if user.role? :administrator
      can :manage, :all
    else
      can :read, :all
    end
  end
